# ULX3S PCB

This is work-in-progress place for putting
some wishes of a small FPGA board.

Instead of describing in written, 
it is better explained when drawn in kicad.

Currently PCB is not routed. Only some footprintes 
are being collected and some are incomplete,

Here are just so get some insight how will it all
physically fit and look.

From production of this, we are far, far away :)

# Features

3.5 mm jack footprint

Completing FPGA shcematics blocks and
checking fitness for the footprint

Switching voltage regulators

USB footprints without thru-holes

SPI OLED placeholder (thru hole probably)

FTDI 2232 usb-jtag chip

SPI flash chip

SDRAM chip

LEDs: 8 blinkleds, 1 usb led

RTC clock, quartz and battery

GPDI 3.3V-5V bidirectional level shifter

# Todo

Check SD card slot footprint

Oscillators (25/50/100 MHz)

rearrange PushButtons: 6 (2+4)

             U
    A B    L D R

IR camera placeholder

OV767 color camera placeholder

2.54 mm external JTAG header
