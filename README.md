# ULX3S PCB

This is work-in-progress place for putting
some wishes of a small FPGA board.

Instead of describing in written, 
it is better explained when drawn in kicad.

Currently PCB is not routed. Only some footprintes 
are being collected and some are incomplete,

Here are just so get some insight how will it all
physically fit and look.

From production of this, we are far, far away :)

TODO

3.5 mm jack footprint

Completing FPGA shcematics blocks and
checking fitness for the footprint

Switching voltage regulators

Check SD card slot footprint

USB and GPDI footprints without thru-holes

SPI OLED placeholder (thru hole probably)

2.54 mm external JTAG header

FTDI usb-jtag chip

Oscillators (25/50/100 MHz)

SPI flash chip for fpga configuration

SDRAM chip 32MB

LEDs: 8 blinkleds, 1 usb led

PushButtons: 6 cursor style
