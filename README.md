# ULX3S PCB

This is work-in-progress place for putting
some wishes of a small FPGA board, RPI-0 size.

Instead of describing in written, 
it is better explained when drawn in kicad.

Currently PCB is not routed. Only some footprintes 
are being collected and some are incomplete,

Here are just so get some insight how will it all
physically fit and look.

From production of this, we are far, far away :)
